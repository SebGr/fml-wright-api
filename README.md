# fml-wright-api

API created to complement the repository fml-wright https://github.com/SebGr/fml-wright.

It is based on the design of https://github.com/eightBEC/fastapi-ml-skeleton.  
I have also added a docker build for the API. 


## FastAPI API
To start the api, do the following in the terminal.
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app
```

It is then reachable through the below url.
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

To see the docs:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  
```

When developing:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Docker API
To use the api through docker, you must first build the docker image and start the service.  
This can be done through the below code.
```bash
sudo docker build -t fml-wright-api:latest .  
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 fml-wright-api:latest  
```

The docker api can be reached through the url below
```bash
http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Usage
Once you have the API up and running, you can either use it via the __docs__ interface, or use the method described in the notebook.
